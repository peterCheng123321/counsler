# Agent & Platform Improvements Plan

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. **Performance - Agent is Too Slow** ‚ö°
**Problem**: Response time is too slow, users wait too long for answers

**Solutions**:
- [ ] Switch to streaming-first architecture (already partially implemented)
- [ ] Implement response caching for common queries
- [ ] Use parallel tool execution where possible
- [ ] Add request queueing to prevent overwhelming the backend
- [ ] Optimize LangGraph graph execution
- [ ] Pre-load context for faster initial responses
- [ ] Reduce token usage in prompts

**Target**: Reduce average response time from 10-15s to 2-3s

### 2. **Capability - Agent Needs Better Understanding** üß†
**Problem**: Users have to give too many detailed instructions

**Solutions**:
- [ ] Add more specialized tools:
  - Student search with fuzzy matching
  - Task creation with smart defaults
  - Deadline analysis and recommendations
  - Application progress tracking
  - College research and recommendations
- [ ] Implement context awareness (know which page user is on)
- [ ] Add memory/conversation history
- [ ] Create agent "modes" for different tasks:
  - Research mode (find information)
  - Action mode (create/update/delete)
  - Analysis mode (insights and recommendations)
- [ ] Pre-built workflows for common tasks

**Target**: User should be able to say "help with John's application" and agent figures out the rest

### 3. **Integration - Embed AI Everywhere** üîå
**Problem**: AI is only in chatbot, should be integrated throughout

**Solutions**:
- [ ] Add "Ask AI" button on every major page
- [ ] Quick AI actions in context menus
- [ ] Smart suggestions based on current view
- [ ] AI-powered search in all lists
- [ ] Inline AI assistance for forms
- [ ] AI-generated content suggestions

**Locations to Add**:
- Students list: "Find students who..."
- Student detail: "Summarize this student", "Suggest next steps"
- Tasks: "What should I focus on today?"
- Essays: Already done ‚úì
- Agent Dashboard: "Optimize my settings"

### 4. **AI-Powered Bulk Upload** üìä
**Problem**: Manual CSV parsing is rigid and error-prone

**Solutions**:
- [ ] Create `/api/v1/students/bulk-upload-ai` endpoint
- [ ] Use AI to:
  - Understand any CSV/Excel format
  - Map columns intelligently
  - Fix common errors (typos, formatting)
  - Validate data and suggest corrections
  - Handle missing required fields
  - Deduplicate entries
- [ ] Show preview with AI suggestions before importing
- [ ] Allow user to approve/reject AI fixes

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// API: POST /api/v1/students/bulk-upload-ai
// 1. User uploads CSV/Excel
// 2. AI analyzes structure and content
// 3. AI maps columns to student fields
// 4. AI fixes errors and validates
// 5. Return preview with suggestions
// 6. User approves and imports
```

### 5. **Image Upload** üñºÔ∏è
**Problem**: No way to upload profile pictures, transcripts, resumes

**Solutions**:
- [ ] Add file upload component
- [ ] Create upload API endpoints
- [ ] Use Supabase Storage for files
- [ ] Support profile pictures, resumes, transcripts
- [ ] Image optimization and thumbnails
- [ ] Drag-and-drop interface

**Storage Structure**:
```
/students/{student_id}/
  - profile.jpg
  - resume.pdf
  - transcript.pdf
  - essay-{id}.pdf
```

### 6. **Data Visualization** üìà
**Problem**: No visual representation of data

**Solutions**:
- [ ] Install chart library (recharts or chart.js)
- [ ] Add dashboards:
  - Application progress timeline
  - Student distribution by graduation year
  - Task completion rates
  - Deadline calendar view
  - College application funnel
- [ ] AI-generated insights on charts
- [ ] Export charts as images

**Charts to Add**:
- Dashboard: Overview widgets
- Students: Distribution charts
- Tasks: Gantt chart, calendar
- Agent Dashboard: Performance graphs

### 7. **Command Palette Enhancements** ‚å®Ô∏è
**Current**: Basic command palette with limited functionality

**Improvements**:
- [ ] AI-powered command suggestions
- [ ] Natural language command processing
- [ ] Recent commands history
- [ ] Command shortcuts for common tasks
- [ ] Context-aware suggestions
- [ ] Fuzzy search for commands
