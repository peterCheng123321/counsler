# Essay Section Fix Guide

## 🐛 What Was Wrong

The essay section was failing because:
1. **Missing `counselor_id`** in the seed script - essays couldn't be inserted or were blocked by RLS policies
2. **Missing fields** in the CREATE essay API - `word_count` and `status` weren't set
3. **Incomplete essay objects** - missing required fields for proper functionality

## ✅ What's Been Fixed (Commit: 19e920b)

### Seed Script (`scripts/seed-mock-students.ts`)
- ✅ Added `counselor_id: DEMO_USER_ID` to essay inserts
- ✅ Now includes all required fields

### Essay Creation API (`app/api/v1/students/[id]/essays/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added `counselor_id` field
- ✅ Added `word_count: 0` default
- ✅ Added `status: "draft"` default
- ✅ Proper initialization for new essays

### New Debug Tool
- ✅ Created `scripts/debug-essays.ts` to diagnose essay issues

## 🚀 How to Fix Your Database

### Step 1: Delete Old Data

Go to **Supabase Dashboard**:
1. Navigate to **Table Editor**
2. Open the **`students`** table
3. **Delete all rows** (this will cascade delete essays and colleges too)

> Why? The old essays don't have `counselor_id` and won't work properly.

### Step 2: Run the FIXED Seed Script

```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-mock-students.ts
```

This will create:
- **8 students** with varied progress
- **12 colleges** (Stanford, Harvard, etc.)
- **48 college applications** with proper foreign keys
- **18 essays** with ALL required fields including `counselor_id`

Expected output:
```
Setting up colleges...
  ✓ Created: Stanford University
  ...

Creating student: Emily Rodriguez
  ✓ Student created with ID: xxx
    ✓ Added college: Stanford University (deadline: 2025-01-15)
    ✓ Added essay: College Essay #1 (completed)
    ✓ Added essay: College Essay #2 (completed)
    ✓ Added essay: College Essay #3 (in progress)
  Summary: 8 applications, 3 essays
```

### Step 3: Verify Essays Were Created

```bash
npx tsx scripts/debug-essays.ts
```

You should see:
```
✅ Found 8 students

📝 Emily Rodriguez (85% progress)
   Essays: 3

   Essay 1:
      ID: xxx
      Title: College Essay #1
      Status: completed
      Word Count: 456
      Content Length: 523 chars
      Has Counselor ID: ✅
      Preview: "As I reflect on my journey through high school..."

   Essay 2:
      ...
```

If you see:
- ❌ `Has Counselor ID: ❌` - The old seed script ran, re-run Step 1 and 2
- ⚠️ `No essays found` - The seed script didn't run properly, check for errors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "No Essays Yet"?

**Option 1: Check Database**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/debug-essays.ts
```

Look for:
- Number of essays per student
- Whether `Has Counselor ID: ✅` is present
- Content length > 0

**Option 2: Check Browser Console**

Open DevTools → Console, look for errors when:
1. Loading the Essays tab
2. Clicking "Create New Essay"
3. Clicking "Save Essay"

Common errors:
- `Failed to fetch essays` - API issue or RLS policy
- `No essay ID available` - Essay object missing `id` field
- `401 Unauthorized` - Authentication issue

**Option 3: Check API Response**

DevTools → Network tab:
1. Go to Essays tab
2. Look for `GET /api/v1/students/{id}/essays`
3. Check response:

**Good response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "xxx",
      "title": "College Essay #1",
      "content": "...",
      "counselor_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
      "status": "completed",
      "word_count": 456
    }
  ],
  "success": true
}
```

**Bad response:**
```json
{
  "data": [],
  "success": true
}
```
→ Essays weren't created or RLS is blocking them

### Save button not working?

1. Open DevTools → Network
2. Click "Save Essay"
3. Look for `PUT /api/v1/essays/{id}`

**Good response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "xxx",
    "title": "Updated Title",
    "content": "Updated content...",
    "word_count": 123
  },
  "success": true
}
```

**Bad responses:**
- `404` - Essay not found (wrong ID)
- `500` - Database error (check Supabase logs)
- `401` - Authentication issue

### Essays show but can't save?

Check:
1. Essay has an `id` field - look at `essay` object in React DevTools
2. The PUT endpoint exists - check `app/api/v1/essays/[id]/route.ts` file
3. Vercel deployed the latest code - check deployment dashboard

## 📊 Expected Database State After Fix

### Essays Table
Each essay should have:
- ✅ `id` (UUID)
- ✅ `student_id` (UUID, foreign key)
- ✅ `counselor_id` (UUID) ← **This was missing!**
- ✅ `title` (string)
- ✅ `content` (text)
- ✅ `prompt` (text, nullable)
- ✅ `word_count` (integer)
- ✅ `status` (enum: draft, in_progress, completed, reviewed)
- ✅ `created_at` (timestamp)
- ✅ `updated_at` (timestamp)

### Sample Data
```sql
SELECT
  e.title,
  e.status,
  e.word_count,
  s.first_name,
  e.counselor_id IS NOT NULL as has_counselor
FROM essays e
JOIN students s ON e.student_id = s.id
LIMIT 5;
```

Should return:
```
College Essay #1 | completed   | 456 | Emily   | true
College Essay #2 | completed   | 512 | Emily   | true
College Essay #3 | in_progress | 423 | Emily   | true
College Essay #1 | completed   | 489 | Marcus  | true
College Essay #2 | in_progress | 445 | Marcus  | true
```

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If after following ALL steps above you still see problems:

### 1. Check Supabase RLS Policies

Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Policies

For the `essays` table, you should have policies that allow:
- **SELECT** where `counselor_id = auth.uid()` OR `counselor_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'`
- **INSERT** where `counselor_id = auth.uid()` OR `counselor_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'`
- **UPDATE** where `counselor_id = auth.uid()` OR `counselor_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'`
- **DELETE** where `counselor_id = auth.uid()` OR `counselor_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'`

### 2. Check Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.local` has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-key
```

And these are also set in **Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables**

### 3. Check Logs

**Supabase Logs:**
Dashboard → Logs → Look for errors around the time you tried to create/save essays

**Vercel Logs:**
Dashboard → Deployments → Click latest → Functions → Look for API errors

---

## 📝 Summary

**What was broken:** Missing `counselor_id` field in essays
**What's been fixed:** All essay creation now includes `counselor_id`
**What you need to do:** Delete old data → Re-run seed script → Wait for deployment

Then essays will work perfectly! 🎉
