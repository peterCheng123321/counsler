## How Insights Are Generated

### Analytics Tools Used

The AI agent uses these tools to analyze data and generate insights:

1. **get_students / get_tasks** ‚Üí Query current data
2. **get_upcoming_deadlines** ‚Üí Deadline monitoring
3. **calculate_statistics** ‚Üí Compute averages, distributions, trends
4. **trend_analysis** ‚Üí Identify patterns over time
5. **deadline_monitor** ‚Üí Proactive deadline checking
6. **generate_insights** ‚Üí Extract actionable recommendations

### Insight Generation Flow

```

## Insight Metadata

Each insight can include optional metadata:

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  category: "deadline" | "student" | "progress" | "risk" | "success" | "recommendation";
  priority: "high" | "medium" | "low";
  finding: string;              // What was detected
  recommendation: string;       // What to do about it
  created_at: string;          // When generated

  // Optional metadata:
  affected_count?: number;     // How many students/tasks affected
  related_data?: {
    student_ids?: string[];    // Specific students involved
    task_ids?: string[];       // Specific tasks involved
    deadline_date?: string;    // Relevant deadline
  }
}
```

This metadata enables:
- **Context-aware actions** (e.g., "View 5 affected students")
- **Deep linking** (jump directly to filtered views)
- **Impact assessment** (prioritize by number affected)
- **Tracking** (mark specific students as addressed)

---

## Customizing Insight Generation

### Configuring Agent Runs

The agent can be configured for different run types:

```typescript
// Daily digest - comprehensive analysis
POST /api/cron/agent-run
{
  "runType": "daily_digest"
}

// Deadline monitoring - focused on upcoming deadlines
POST /api/cron/agent-run
{
  "runType": "deadline_monitor"
}

// Risk assessment - identify at-risk students
POST /api/cron/agent-run
{
  "runType": "risk_assessment"
}

// Manual - on-demand analysis
POST /api/cron/agent-run
{
  "runType": "manual"
}
```

### Vercel Cron Schedule (Recommended)

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/agent-run",
      "schedule": "0 8 * * *"  // Daily at 8am - comprehensive
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/agent-run?type=deadline",
      "schedule": "0 */6 * * *"  // Every 6 hours - deadlines
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Counselors:
1. **Review insights daily** - Check each morning for new alerts
2. **Expand high-priority first** - Click "Show More" on red badges
3. **Take smart actions** - Use quick action buttons to navigate
4. **Mark done when addressed** - Keep insight list actionable
5. **Dismiss irrelevant** - Clean up to focus on what matters

### For Administrators:
1. **Monitor insight frequency** - Too many = alert fatigue
2. **Tune priority thresholds** - Adjust what triggers high vs. medium
3. **Track action rates** - Which insights get acted upon?
4. **Collect feedback** - Ask counselors what's helpful
5. **Iterate prompts** - Refine agent queries for better insights

---

## Troubleshooting

**No insights showing up?**
- Check agent run history in `/agent-dashboard`
- Verify cron jobs are running
- Ensure database has student/task data
- Test manual run: `POST /api/cron/agent-run`

**Too many insights?**
- Increase insight expiration time
- Raise priority thresholds
- Configure max_insights_per_run limit
- Focus on specific categories

**Insights not relevant?**
- Review agent prompts in `/lib/ai/langgraph-agent.ts`
- Check if tools have correct data access
- Verify analytics calculations
- Consider custom run types
