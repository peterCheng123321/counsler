## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set up Supabase project**:
   - Run migration: `supabase db push` (using CLI)
   - Enable Google OAuth provider in Supabase dashboard
   - Configure redirect URLs

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Add all API keys to Vercel environment variables
   - Set up Supabase connection (via CLI)

3. **Test the application**:
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Test Google login flow
   - Add students and tasks
   - Test filtering and search

4. **Connect AI services**:
   - Implement AI provider abstraction layer
   - Wire OpenAI Assistant API for chatbot
   - Integrate Pinecone for college info RAG

5. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy and test

## 📝 Notes

- Auth is handled via Supabase Auth (JWT-based), which is more secure than custom JWT implementation
- Database schema includes RBAC structure but enforcement is deferred to Phase 2 for MVP stability
- All API endpoints include proper error handling and validation
- UI components follow PRD design specifications
- Performance optimizations (caching, indexing) are in place
