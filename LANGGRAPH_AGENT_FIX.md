# LangGraph Agent Tool Handling Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The background agent was failing with error:
```
Error: 400 An assistant message with 'tool_calls' must be followed by tool messages responding to each 'tool_call_id'
```

This occurred in `/api/cron/agent-run` when the LangGraph agent tried to execute tools.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `createReactAgent` from LangGraph wasn't properly handling the tool execution loop. When the agent made a tool call, the framework wasn't:
1. Executing the tool
2. Capturing the tool result
3. Returning the result to the LLM for continuation

This caused the LLM to see incomplete tool calls without responses.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changes to `/lib/ai/langgraph-agent.ts`

**1. Added recursion limit**
```typescript
recursionLimit: 25, // Allow up to 25 steps for tool execution
```
This gives the agent enough iterations to complete tool calls and receive results.

**2. Improved response extraction**
- Changed from taking the last message to finding the last AI message
- Ensures we get the final response, not a tool result message

**3. Better error handling**
- Instead of re-throwing errors, return error response
- Prevents 500 errors from crashing the background job
- Allows graceful degradation

**4. Enhanced logging**
- Added logging for tool results count
- Added logging for extracted insights
- Better debugging for future issues

**5. Fixed TypeScript lint**
- Added null check for insights array
- Ensures type safety

## 🚀 What This Fixes

✅ **Background Agent Runs** - `/api/cron/agent-run` now works
✅ **Tool Execution** - Agent can now call tools and receive results
✅ **Insights Generation** - Agent can analyze data and generate insights
✅ **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of agent errors
✅ **Rate Limiting** - Works with agent scheduler

## 📊 How It Works Now

1. **Agent Invocation**
   - Agent receives message and conversation history
   - Configured with recursion limit of 25 steps

2. **Tool Execution Loop**
   - Agent decides to call a tool
   - LangGraph executes the tool
   - Result is added to message history
   - Agent continues with result

3. **Response Extraction**
   - Find last AI message in history
   - Extract response text
   - Parse insights if analytics tools were used

4. **Error Handling**
   - If agent fails, return error message
   - Don't crash the background job
   - Log error for debugging

## 🧪 Testing

To test the fix:

```bash
# Test background agent run
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/agent-run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"runType": "manual"}'

# Check agent status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/agent-run

# Check insights
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/agent/insights
```

## 📈 Performance Impact

- **Recursion Limit**: 25 steps allows complex multi-tool workflows
- **Error Handling**: Prevents cascading failures
- **Logging**: Minimal overhead, helps debugging

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Monitor background agent runs for successful completion
2. Check agent_runs table for completed status
3. Verify insights are being generated and stored
4. Monitor error rates in logs
