## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Seed Your Database

### Why You Still See "0 applications"

**Your database is either empty or has old broken data.** The new seed script is ready but hasn't been run yet.

### How to Fix (2 Steps)

#### Step 1: Clean Old Data
Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Table Editor** → `students` table → **Delete all rows**

#### Step 2: Run New Seed Script
```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-mock-students.ts
```

Expected output:
```
Setting up colleges...
  ✓ Created: Stanford University
  ✓ Created: Harvard University
  ...

Creating student: Emily Rodriguez
  ✓ Student created with ID: xxx
    ✓ Added college: Stanford University (deadline: 2025-01-15)
    ✓ Added essay: College Essay #1 (completed)
  Summary: 8 applications, 3 essays
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "0 applications"?

**Option 1: Check Database**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-database.ts
```

**Option 2: Check API Response**
Open browser DevTools → Network → Look for `/api/v1/students/{id}/colleges`
- If returns empty `[]` → Database not seeded
- If returns data → Clear cache and hard refresh

**Option 3: Verify Deployment**
Check Vercel dashboard - is the latest commit deployed?

### Essay editor not saving?

1. Open DevTools → Network
2. Click "Save Essay"
3. Look for `PUT /api/v1/essays/{id}` request
4. Check response - should return `{ success: true, data: {...} }`

If you see errors, check that:
- Essay has an `id` field
- You're logged in (DEMO_USER_ID is set)
- Supabase credentials are correct
