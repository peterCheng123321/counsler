- Tasks policies
- Notes policies
- Conversations policies
- Notifications policies
- Student colleges policies
- Essays policies
- Activities policies
- Messages policies

- **Note:** Users policy skipped (users.id is bigint, not UUID)

✅ **Triggers Created:**
- `update_updated_at_column()` function
- Triggers for `updated_at` on all relevant tables

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Users Table Issue
- Your `users` table has `bigint` id (not UUID)
- This means it doesn't match Supabase Auth's `auth.users.id` (which is UUID)
- The users RLS policy was skipped to avoid errors
- **Next Step:** You may need to migrate users.id from bigint to UUID separately if you want to use Supabase Auth

### ✅ Foreign Key Constraints
- Foreign keys were intentionally skipped in this migration
- This prevents errors with existing data
- You can add them later if needed

### ✅ Data Preservation
- All your existing student data is preserved
- All existing records remain intact

## Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check all tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check students table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'students' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check policies
SELECT tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Check indexes
SELECT tablename, indexname 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Migration applied successfully
2. ✅ Verify tables and columns in Supabase Dashboard
3. ✅ Test your API endpoints
4. ⚠️ Consider migrating users.id from bigint to UUID if using Supabase Auth
5. ✅ Your application should now work with the updated schema!
